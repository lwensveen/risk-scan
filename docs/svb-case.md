# Silicon Valley Bank 2023 collapse — case study

> **How RiskScan would have surfaced the warning signs by September 2022**

---

## TL;DR

| Month        | Public signal                                                                             | RiskScan flag                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Mar 2022** | HTM (“held‑to‑maturity”) securities pass \$90 bn (≈ 57 % of total assets).                | `HTMConcentration` (severity ⚠️)  |
| **Jun 2022** | Unrealised HTM losses > **\$1.3 bn**.                                                     | `UnrealisedLosses↑` (severity ⚠️) |
| **Sep 2022** | Unrealised losses hit **\$15 bn**; equity = \$16 bn → **94 %** of equity eroded on paper. | `EquityWipeoutRisk` (severity 🚨) |
| **Dec 2022** | Moody’s warns of downgrade.                                                               | `CreditWatch` (severity ⚠️)       |
| **Mar 2023** | 48h deposit run; FDIC takeover.                                                           | —                                 |

RiskScan’s `EquityWipeoutRisk` + `GoingConcern` combo would have triggered six months before the bank run, giving
portfolio managers ample time to de‑risk.

_Real data source: SVB 10‑Q filings, Note 3 (Available‑For‑Sale & Held‑To‑Maturity securities)._

**Risk rule** (`engine‑core`):

```ts
if (unrealisedHtmLoss / totalEquity > 0.5) {
  addFlag(RiskFlag.EquityWipeoutRisk, Severity.High);
}
```

Outcome: fires on 10‑Q (Sep 30 2022) → High‑severity flag published next day.

## 2 Liquidity stress visible in footnotes

SVB’s Sep 2022 10‑Q footnote 13 (“Liquidity risk”) includes:

> “_There is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity obligations in a timely manner should
> deposit outflows accelerate…_”

RiskScan’s **`detectGoingConcern`** prompt returns `true` → `GoingConcern` flag (severity 🚨).
